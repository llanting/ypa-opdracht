# YPA Movies

## Description
An app that shows the poster and titles for 10 (superhero) movies. Every movie is clickable and shows a page with detailed info. For the first assignment I made use of Bootstrap and a mockup data file called 'movies.json'. For the rest of the assignments I made use of the OMDB Api. Made for YPA. 

## Tech used
Made with JavaScipt, React, CSS and Bootstrap.

## API Reference
